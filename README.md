# 👕 AI-Powered Stylist API (a.k.a. "DripGPT")  

## 💀 What is this?  
Bro, this is **THE** backend for an AI stylist that probably knows fashion better than you. It’s running on pure *vibe coding™*, held together by **MongoDB, Express, and a prayer.**  

It takes your closet (which might be tragic), your mood, the weather, and some AI magic to tell you what to wear. It even has onboarding, so it knows your favorite color—because apparently, that matters.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (or "What’s keeping this mess alive?")  
- **Node.js & Express** – Because why not?  
- **MongoDB** – For hoarding all your questionable outfit choices.  
- **JWT Auth** – So random people don’t pick outfits for you.  
- **EmailJS** – Because you WILL forget your password.  

---

## 🚀 API Features (A.K.A. "What Actually Works?")  
- 🔑 **Auth System** – Sign up, log in, reset your password when you forget it (again).  
- 🏠 **Onboarding** – Tell the API who you are, so it can judge your taste better.  
- 👕 **Wardrobe Management** – Add, edit, and remove clothes you *claim* you own.  
- 🎭 **Outfit Generator** – AI-powered fit suggestions based on your *vibe* (or lack thereof).  
- 📜 **Wishlist** – Because you’re too broke to buy everything at once.

- **Express**, for making APIs easy enough for *vibe coding*.
